## Overview

The CDEvents Implementation Working Group focuses on defining the functional and non-functional requirements for implementing [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev). Our aim is to create an architecture and implementation plan that ensures seamless integration, scalability, and performance of CDEvents within various CI/CD ecosystems without the requirement to update every pipeline or workflow. 

### Objectives

* Define Functional Requirements: Establish clear and concise functional requirements for CDEvents to ensure interoperability and ease of use across different tools and platforms.
* Identify Non-Functional Requirements: Outline the non-functional requirements, including performance, scalability, security, testing, and maintainability.
* Develop Reference Architectures: Create reference architectures that demonstrate best practices for implementing CDEvents, based on use cases identified.
* Tooling Recommendations: Provide recommendations for tools and technologies that can be used to implement and support CDEvents.
* Tooling and Library Consistency: Ensure our tooling and libraries utilize consistent patterns and semantics allowing users to transition between different tools/libraries more easily while also following best practices per language.
* Documentation and Guidelines: Develop comprehensive documentation and examples on how to use CDEvents.

### Areas of Focus
* Message Broker - Cloud event pub/sub technologies
* Persistence - Document store and graph data retrieval
* Data Collection  - Active and passive event creation, how are events triggered
* CDEvent tooling and libraries - Allow for tools and libraries that we support to work seamlessly with CDEvents related technologies
* Cross project collaboration - Getting project to implement events
* Visualization - Ability to see the event paths.
